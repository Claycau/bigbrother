Summary of paper
	I think the most novel thing we can bring is a exhaustive comparison of the various forecasting techniques to this sort of building data.  To that end I think we should attempt to come up with a few simple but exotic metrics which may be of use when decided on the forecasting method for a specific application.  

	That is I would like to measure such things as:
		* SMAPE and RMSE (standard error measurements) vs future forecasting amount (how many time steps in the future to forecast)
		* residual variance vs future forcasting amount 
		* % of forecasts under or over actual data (is one type always under, always over, etc)
		* how poorly does the forcast miss when it misses (this may be something like the avg residual of the top 5% of misforcasts)
		* how does it do during peak times (in other buildings this would probably be lunch time) in our building class time
		* to do a quick couple of hour search for other forecasting measurements we may use

	Also I think we should compare a considerable number of models as producing them should be pretty quick.
		* SARIMA (best fit)
		* Random walk
		* Daily Mean
		* Time Delayed Neural Network
		* Non-linear auto regressive exogenious
		* I would take other suggestions if you would like to see them here, i.e. some polynomial regression, lowess fit, hmm, etc
		* I can also implement bayesian combined forecasting with any combination of the above models if we would like


Outline of paper:

	1. Introduction
		* discuss need for building forecasting by discussing potential energy savings and possible security applications
		* discuss briefly our approach of using a wireless network for simple sensors to get a global view of the building
		* give a brief outline of the rest of the paper

	2. Prior work
		* I will run another check of papers tomorrow and look at the work linked in the paper you sent, but if all holds true I want to focus on the lack of forecasting work specific to buildings.  
			- I can talk about the MERL work and work you found and anything else I find on building monitoring
		* If forecasting is still as sparse as I suspect I will then discuss some other areas (such as traffic and stock values) where these forecasting techniques have been used to some extent

	3. Data Network
		* Discuss the motes that we used to collect the network
		* Talk a bit about the sensors and the collection rate

	4. Forecasting

		* Data preprocessing
			- discuss our aggregation methods
			- cleaning missing values from motes that were down
			- combining of motes if necessary

		* Forecasting Algorithms
			- SARIMA math
				- I am not sure how much I should go into fitting Seasonal ARIMA models here.  I plan to be somewhat quick with my description and perhaps only discuss and not show graphs of the Auto correlation and partial auto correlation graphs
				- I could also talk about the Box LJung portmanu test for white noise and how it passes for inter-day forcasts

			- Random Walk
				- This shouldn't take much description, it is simply a linear regression on the prior reading only.  I very simple model

			- Mean model
				- Similarly little description as the random walk

			- Time Delay Neural Network
				- Discuss the model in brief and perhaps about bit about how we forecast n steps in the future as that is not trivial (you have to run the model outputs back into the input of the model recursively)
				- Discuss our fitting of the best parameters based on an exhaustive run of all parameters and finding the one which gives the best validation set RMSE

			- Non-linear auto regressive exogenious model
				- Outline the math with the same detail as TDNN and SARIMA
				- Similar to TDNN discuss our parameter fit through optimal validation set results
				- Also I am not sure if a writeup of the math to forecast with the model is necessary.  It is quite similar to the math to forecast with SARIMA models.

	5. Results

		* Metrics used
			- Brief writeup of each metric we created.  See above summary of paper for the metrics
			- I would like to show plots of many of the statistics that I spoke about earlier.  I can envision a plot on SMAPE or RMSE vs forecasting horizon for each model
			- Perhaps a plot on the top %5 rmse vs forecasting horizon for each model

	6. Conclusion of results outline any special results we have obtained (I suspect that Seasonal ARIMA will give us the best SMAPE and RMSE scores while TDNN will yield results with a variance reduction on the forecasts)
