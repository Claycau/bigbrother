Todo:

- Combine Jim's notes with mine




Mote Lifetime:

- Initialize stuff
- Ask user to enter binary code for mote with button one, ok with button two
  - Show code in LEDs
- Turn off LEDs
- Main loop
  always run:
    - While button one is pressed show binary code on LEDs
    - If time/date is XXXX, state is Data transmission ########## maybe wait for ping here instead, if battery life allows
    - If time/date is XXXX + delta t, state is Normal operation
  states:
    - Normal operation
      -
    - Data transmission  ########## maybe flash an LED every few seconds while in this mode
      - Wait for ping from computer
      - Prepare data
        - Battery voltage
        - Mote binary code and static ID
        - Event data
      - Calculate MD5 hash of data before transmission
      - Send MD5 hash
      - Send data
      - Wait for computer response
      - If computer's MD5 does not match data's MD5, resend data
      - If does match, erase event data from mote
      - State is Normal transmission

        
        
        
Events and Data Storage:

Event Model (~10 bytes)
- timestamp : date/time
- sensor type : byte
- sensor data : int



TODO:
- Add some sort of switch statement for state machine
