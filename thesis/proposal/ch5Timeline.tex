\section{Expected Results}
Because seasonal ARIMA models appear to be on par with the current state of the art approach for performing traffic prediction, we at the least expect to outperform such models.  We expect to empirically demonstrate on test data a performance improvement over seasonal ARIMA models.  We also hope to demonstrate the efficacy of our activity recognition method and the accuracy of our performance metric.
