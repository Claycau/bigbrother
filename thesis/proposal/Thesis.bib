@article{Juang1991,
abstract = {The use of hidden Markov models for speech recognition has become predominant in the last several years, as evidenced by the number of published papers and talks at major speech conferences. The reasons this method has become so popular are the inherent statistical (mathematically precise) framework: the ease and availability of training algorithms for es- timating the parameters of the models from finite training sets of speech data; the flexibility of the resulting recognition system in which one can easily change the size, type, or architecture of the models to suit particular words, sounds. and so forth; and the ease of implementation of the overall recognition system. In this expository article, we address the role of statistical methods in this powerful technology as applied to speech recognition and discuss a range of theoretical and practical issues that are as yet unsolved in terms of their importance and their effect on performance for different system implementations.},

abstract = {The k-means method is a widely used clustering technique that seeks to minimize the average squared distance between points in the same cluster. Although it offers no accuracy guarantees, its simplicity and speed are very appealing in practice. By augmenting k-means with a very simple, ran- domized seeding technique, we obtain an algorithm that is $\Theta$(log k)-competitive with the optimal clustering. Prelim- inary experiments show that our augmentation improves both the speed and the accuracy of k-means, often quite dramatically.},

LDA is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model, in which each item of a collection is modeled as a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics. Each topic is, in turn, modeled as an infinite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document. We present efficient approximate inference techniques based on variational methods and an EM algorithm for empirical Bayes parameter estimation. We report results in document modeling, text classification, and collaborative filtering, comparing to a mixture of unigrams model and the probabilistic LSI model.},

@article{Wren2006,
abstract = {Sensor networks hold the promise of truly intelligent buildings: buildings that adapt to the behavior of their occupants to improve productivity, efficiency, safety, and security. To be practical, such a networkmust be economical to manufacture, install and maintain. Similarly, the methodology must be efficient and must scale well to very large spaces. Finally, be be widely acceptable, it must be inherently privacy-sensitive. We propose to address these requirements by employing networks of passive infrared (PIR) motion detectors. PIR sensors are inexpensive, reliable, and require very little bandwidth. They also protect privacy since they are neither capable of directly identifying individuals nor of capturing identifiable imagery or audio. However, with an appropriate analysis methodology, we show that they are capable of providing useful contextual information. The methodology we propose supports scalability by adopting a hierarchical framework that splits computation into localized, distributed tasks. To support our methodology we provide theoretical justification for the method that grounds it in the action recognition literature. We also present quantitative results on a dataset that we have recorded from a 400 square meter wing of our laboratory. Specifically, we report quantitative results that show better than 90\% recognition performance for low-level activities such as walking, loitering, and turning. We also present experimental results for mid-level activities such as visiting and meeting. To},
