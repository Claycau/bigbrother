If accurate estimates of future traffic patterns at each traffic light were available then dynamically changing the light timings to account for such traffic would improve overall traffic flow.

In both of the above scenarios motion through the environment can be captured through a network of many sensors.  For vehicular traffic systems, networks already exist using inductive loops and radar based sensors to count the number of cars in a given unit of time.  In the case of buildings, such networks are not as common.  To acquire such counts one could install a network using many infrared motion sensors and cameras to count human motion through the building.
