@article{Meyn2009,
abstract = {We introduce the sensor-utility-network (SUN) method for occupancy estimation in buildings. Based on inputs from a variety of sensor measurements, along with historical data regarding building utilization, the SUN estimator produces occupancy estimates through the solution of a receding-horizon convex optimization problem. State-of-the-art on-line occupancy algorithms rely on indirect measurements, such as CO2 levels, or people counting sensors which are subject to significant errors and cost. The newly proposed method was evaluated via experiments in an office building environment. Estimation accuracy is shown to improve significantly when all available data is incorporated in the estimator. In particular, it is found that the average estimation error at the building level is reduced from 70\% to 11\% using the SUN estimator, when compared to the naive approach that relies solely on flow measurements.},

abstract = {This paper presents an application of the artificial neural network (ANN) in a building system. The objective of this study is to develop an optimized ANN model to predict the time of room air temperature descending. In this study, a program for predicting room air temperature and an ANN program based on back-propagation learning were developed, and learning data for 27 spaces were collected through simulation using systems of experimental design for predicting room air temperature. ANN was trained and the ANN model having the optimized values of learning rate, moment, bias, number of hidden layer, and number of neurons of hidden layer was presented and its performance on predicting the descent time to desired room air temperature was evaluated. The results showed that the optimized ANN can predict the time of room air temperature descending with relative accuracy.},

abstract = {We show that it is possible to extract geometric descriptions of the spaces observed by sensor networks, even if the network consists of sensors that are of very limited ability: such as motion detectors. By using statistical techniques and relying only on the unconstrained patterns generated by the occupants of the building we show how to recover information about sensor geometry. This is important to the ubiquitous computing community since ubiquitous sensors and the context that the provide will only become a reality if the sensors are cheap, low-power, and self-configuring.},

@article{Wren2006,
abstract = {Sensor networks hold the promise of truly intelligent buildings: buildings that adapt to the behavior of their occupants to improve productivity, efficiency, safety, and security. To be practical, such a networkmust be economical to manufacture, install and maintain. Similarly, the methodology must be efficient and must scale well to very large spaces. Finally, be be widely acceptable, it must be inherently privacy-sensitive. We propose to address these requirements by employing networks of passive infrared (PIR) motion detectors. PIR sensors are inexpensive, reliable, and require very little bandwidth. They also protect privacy since they are neither capable of directly identifying individuals nor of capturing identifiable imagery or audio. However, with an appropriate analysis methodology, we show that they are capable of providing useful contextual information. The methodology we propose supports scalability by adopting a hierarchical framework that splits computation into localized, distributed tasks. To support our methodology we provide theoretical justification for the method that grounds it in the action recognition literature. We also present quantitative results on a dataset that we have recorded from a 400 square meter wing of our laboratory. Specifically, we report quantitative results that show better than 90\% recognition performance for low-level activities such as walking, loitering, and turning. We also present experimental results for mid-level activities such as visiting and meeting. To},
