abstract = {This paper presents an application of the artificial neural network (ANN) in a building system. The objective of this study is to develop an optimized ANN model to predict the time of room air temperature descending. In this study, a program for predicting room air temperature and an ANN program based on back-propagation learning were developed, and learning data for 27 spaces were collected through simulation using systems of experimental design for predicting room air temperature. ANN was trained and the ANN model having the optimized values of learning rate, moment, bias, number of hidden layer, and number of neurons of hidden layer was presented and its performance on predicting the descent time to desired room air temperature was evaluated. The results showed that the optimized ANN can predict the time of room air temperature descending with relative accuracy.},
